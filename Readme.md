In this exercise we have implemented uniform and non uniform scalar quantizers.

# In "Uniform_Quantizers.py" we have

* Generated full and 25 dB low sine and triangular waves
* Applied Midtread and Midrise quantizers
* Read a wave file
* Quantized the wave file with Midtread and Midrise quantizers
* calculated the Signal to Noise ratio for both quantizers

# In "NonUniform_Quantizers.py" we have
* calculated the quantization error
* Applied the mu-law for non uniform quantization

# Usage
python Uniform_Quantizers.py
python NonUniform_Quantizers.py
